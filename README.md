# Fast-statistics

Fast-statistics is a small package of various statistical methods for Python 2.7 implemented in Rust. The idea was taken from statistics package for Python 3 (see https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html) which is not backported for Python 2.7. Another point is to achieve better performance with Rust instead of pure Python implementation, which is the case for Python 3.

I want to point out that I'm not an experienced Rust developer so PRs, comments and improvements are welcome!
