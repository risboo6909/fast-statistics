# Fast-statistics

Fast-statistics is a small package of various statistical methods for Python 2/Python 3 implemented in Rust. The idea was taken from Python 3 statistics package (see https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html). This package is currently written on pure python and doesn't have Python 2 version.

Fast-statistics implements all the functionality as the original library but it also works mostly faster and can be compiled to work with Python 2 with no troubles.

There are few variants of each function usually, one for floats, one for unsigned integers and one for signed integers.

Pull-requests are welcome!
